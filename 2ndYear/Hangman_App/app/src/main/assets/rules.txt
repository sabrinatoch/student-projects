⚔️︎ The Nazgul are after you, young hobbit... You must protect the Ring of Power at all cost.
⚔️︎ Guess each letter using the alphabetic keypad. Each time you guess incorrectly, you get slashed by the Nazgul's Morgul-knife.
⚔️︎ If you lose 6 hearts, the Nazgul claims your soul and steals the Ring of Power. If you guess the word before that happens, you survive and escape.
⚔️ To display a hint, use the Ring to hide yourself. This takes away one of your lives, as you succumb to Sauron's will. You cannot win or lose on a hint.
⚔️ Remember... “It's only a passing thing, this shadow; even darkness must pass.”
