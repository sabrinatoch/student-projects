# *Happy Valley Kennels Project*

# *Assignment 3 â€“ T-SQL Test Case Design and Implementation (Individual Assignment)*

Date assigned: March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Date due: April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024 @11:59PM

**You will be given partial lab time the week of March 18<sup>th</sup> and April 1<sup>st</sup> to work
on this assignment.**

**Learning Objectives**

After completing this assignment, the student will be able to:

1.  Write test cases in advance of implementing code;
2.	Write T-SQL Stored Procedures;
3.	Write T-SQL Triggers;
4.	Create test data inserts and use transactions; and
5.	Write automated test cases.


**To be submited via GitHub:**

1.  **ANSWERS.md** file containing the SQL
    code and sample output for this assignment as indicated in the
    instructions below.

**To Start:**

1.  Create your HVK database in SSMS by running the script provided
    `db/SQL_Server_HVK_A3_W2024.sql`. Remember to update the script to
    use your initials, i.e. change the \_xy in HVK_xy to *your* initials.

2.  Create the diagram/model for your database using the Diagrams
    feature in SSMS. You will need to refer to this to help you with
    your query logic.

3.  For each of the questions, ensure that you place a comment block at
    the top of your code that includes your name, the course name and
    number, the assignment number, the question number, and a short
    description of the purpose of your block of code. You should have a
    block for procedures etc. and a different one for the test code.

4.  Ensure that your code uses the PascalCase naming convention.
