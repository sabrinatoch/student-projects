**Contains work from the final Database Management I Assignment.**<br>
In this group project, my teammates and I created a fully normalized physical data model for a pet kennel reservation system for a company called "Happy Valley Kennel" or HVK. We collaborated in designing the data model and created it using Oracle SQL Data Modeler. We then implemented it with SQL Developer.
