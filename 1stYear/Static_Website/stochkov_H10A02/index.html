            <span class="bold">GreaseMonkey Univeristy</span> provides
            affordable courses for anybody looking to learn some car mechanic
            skills. We are a family owned and operated company located right
            beside Ottawa, founded by Konstantin Tochkov and his wife, Elissa in
            1985. The Bulgarian couple started the auto shop when the movie
            "Back to the Future" came out, which inspired the signature Delorean
            design and slogan. We've helped many save hundreds of thousands on
            car repairs and maintenance tasks by teaching them to do it
            themselves! Our aim is to get you to be comfortable under your hood,
            and get you back to YOUR garage!

          GreaseMonkey University helped me save so much money. Once I took a
          few of their basic courses, I never had to pay a professional to
          maintain my SUV again!<br /><br />

          Friendliest, most welcoming staff I've encountered. Very down-to-earth
          family that will get you exactly what you need for a very reasonable
          price.<br /><br />

          My dad enrolled me in the oil change course. I didn't think I'd
          understand because I'm 15, but I changed my parents' oil today. GMU
          really helped me and gave me the confidence to try the spark plug
          course! I'm excited for my next lesson.<br /><br />
