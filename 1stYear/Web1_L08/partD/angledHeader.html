			<h2>Canadian Geese</h2>
			<p>Extremely adept at living in human-altered areas, Canada geese have established breeding colonies in
				urban and cultivated habitats, which provide food and few natural predators. The success of this common
				park species has led to its often being considered a pest species because of its excrement, its
				depredation of crops, its noise, its aggressive territorial behavior toward both humans and other
				animals, and its habit of stalking and begging for food, the latter a result of humans disobeying
				artificial feeding policies toward wild animals.</p>
			<p>Like most geese, the Canada goose is naturally migratory with the wintering range being most of the
				United States. The calls overhead from large groups of Canada geese flying in a V-shaped formation
				signal the transitions into spring and autumn. In some areas, migration routes have changed due to
				changes in habitat and food sources. In mild climates from southwestern British Columbia to California
				to the Great Lakes, some of the population has become nonmigratory due to adequate winter food supply
				and a lack of former predators.</p>
