### 1st year, 2nd semester
**Contains work for the 2nd Programming II Assignment.**<br>
I used Java to create a Sudoku Game, which allows the user to save their progress, undo their moves and many more interactive features. I practiced writing efficient code for reading and writing to files as well as writing robust game logic separate from the interface (all the logic was kept in the **SudokuGame** class, separate from UI classes).<br>
The **SudokuInterface** class includes the sudoku gameplay entirely in the console.<br>
The **SudokuFrame** class includes the JFrame game of sudoku.
